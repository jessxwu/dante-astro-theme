Hi there!

Happy for you to have found this page. This is a text-based site to house my writing.<br> <br>

<em>A little bit about me.</em><br>
I'm obsessed with the art of capturing the story. <br>
I'm a marketer by day, and I guess I'm great at getting people to part ways with their cash. <br>
I moonlight as a foodie (read: glutton), fitness & nutrition enthusiast, music geek, linguistics nerd, and armchair philosopher.
<br><br>

I'm a fearless purveyor of the open web. I probably spend too much time reading articles (and not enough books!). <br>
I'm a big advocate of always learning and continuous self-improvement. <br>
I'm obsessive with lists and cataloguing my life.
I'm also organized as heck (but also sometimes disorganized as heck), and this paradoxical chaos is sort of the paradox of myself.<br><br>

I love surrounding myself with great people that keep me growing and grounded.<br>
I love adventurous people, someone that says yes most of the time. <br>
I run and I gym and I bike and I yoga. Obsessed with the sun and I need to be moving at all times.
I'm also a big fan of dancing poorly - but passionately!
<br> <br>

Self-awareness, discipline, and empathy is big for me. Also, a willingness to get out of your comfort zone, learn and try new things, or at least just have a conversation about it. I'll try anything twice. <br>
I don't take myself too seriously and relish in being a little bit odd. <br> <br>

I'm passionate about waste reduction, economic empowerment, and equality. <br> <br>

I update this page in a sporadic and unceremonious fashion, so no promises that it's up-to-date or organized. <br> <br>
