*I update this page in a sporadic and unceremonious fashion. Last update: 7th Aug 2024.*

**Job search**  
I'm looking for a new job. I took a 4-month break to travel and see the sights. Now I'm back home, and seeking my next thing.

**Employable skills**  
Upskilling with digital apps and tools. Learning marketing niches that I'm less familiar with, like SEO. Tinkering with AI and tooling my personal tech stack.

**Website development**  
Retiring my previous site built on Jekyll, and decided on Astro.js. Played around with Netlify (which was great, but unnecessary) and explored headless CMS integration (too complicated for me), so went back to Github Pages. Currently migrating the content over.

**Building my Second Brain and tools for life**  
Working on my digital Second Brain. Rethinking how I organise my Notion, Todoist, notes, and document drives. Migrating my page links from Pocket to Raindrop.io to organise document snippets, and web highlights, images, text. Put Android vs Apple up to the test for several months, but Apple won for me. A lot of app testing.

**Fitness**  
Fitness has been pretty consistent, although I've had to force myself to prioritize between doing too much all at once. Mostly working on my handstands these days and calisthenics. Gym and yoga are mostly just for maintenance of strength and flexibility these days and so I get some movement in. Forced to take a break from running since April as my recurring hip injury came back with a vengeance. Picked up a new old bike, so now commute with 2 wheels often.

**Food**  
I have developed an addition to sugar I haven't been able to curb. Ice cream season has not been helpful. I still really enjoy going out to eat and have been working on a side project mapping out major cuisines of the world by geography. Also have done a lot of mapping of my yummies and places to eat and try on Google Maps.

**Entertainment**  
Stuart and I have been watching Sweet Home on Netflix, as well as some documentaries (Simone Biles).
