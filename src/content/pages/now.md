  description: Current update on priorities in my life.

**Job search**  
I'm looking for a new job. I took a 4-month break to travel and see the sights, but I'm ready for my next thing.

**My skills**  
New tools and marketing exploration.

**Website development**  
Currently tinkering around with some personal projects. Retiring my previous site built on Jekyll, and exploring Astro.js!

**Tools for life**  
A lot of app testing and curation to figure out my set-up.  
Rethinking how I organise my Notion, Todoist, notes, and document drives.
Looking at Raindrop.io to organise document snippets and migrating from Pocket.

**Getting fit**  
Maintaining consistency is my goal here, but current priorities are:
- Learning how to hold a handstand. Amazing teachers @ The Rogue Room, where I attend 2 - 3 classes a week, and practice at the gym when I can.
- Weight training 3-4x a week, working on pull-ups, deadhangs, pistol squats, and just maintaining general strength.
- Yoga 2x, mostly for flexibility and mobility (dialing back as I level up calisthenics training)
- Swimming a bit on pause, because I find it a hassle to shower and wash my hair so often.
- Running, when I feel like I can. Have been injured since April, so haven't been able to do longer or faster runs without pain. Starting doing socials runs with Progress Running Club - roughly clocking 5 - 15km a week only. 
- Cycling: picked up a new old bike a few months ago again, cycling everywhere after a 1-year hiatus!
- Tools: My 2017-era Fitbit Charge 2 finally crapped out. I've switched to Garmin now, after a brief trial with Whoop. Progress-tracking wise; I've experimented with not tracking my workouts in a notebook this last year. I will go back to tracking soon.
