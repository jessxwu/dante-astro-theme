Zany, offbeat humour that is very much self-aware of its oddity. It does have its clever bits and I found myself hmmm-ing and ahhh-ing along with it at times.

What a trip inside the mind of Douglas Adams. Points for style, but lacking a enticing story.

For some reason, I feel like I would have really enjoyed reading this as a kid (suffice for all the advanced words!). Maybe I'm too devoid of an active imagination and couldn't really let myself get lost in this world. Too many non-sequiteurs and frustrating deus ex machina twists for me to enjoy the plotline. Too quirky, too 'lol rAnDoM'. Maybe that's why it's taken 3 abandons for me to finally finish this one.

Rating: 2.5/5
