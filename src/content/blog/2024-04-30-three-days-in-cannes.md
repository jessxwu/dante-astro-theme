Here's the letter.

To Whom It May Concern,

As my life is about to come to an end (read: turning 29), my last dying wish is to receive an accreditation to the “Three Days in Cannes” program in my last eligible year as a young and spritely cinephile.

Sensationalist clichés aside, I was very lucky to attend “Three Days in Cannes” in 2022.

I watched eight films in those three whirlwind days, my eyes slightly glazed from the (occasional) back-to-back screenings (rushing from theatre to theatre in my tiny heels - making a mental note to carry some barefoot flats for next time) while suffering acutely from jet lag, and noting the odd dichotomy of my body fighting to stay awake physically, but also my brain and heart so mentally stimulated, alert… alive! by the marvel and talent and brilliant storytelling that graced the screens and filled up my very eager heart. It was a dizzying but glamorous experience. I was bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, and filled with the wonder and delight of film. A lifelong dream come true… The madness and pure intensity of my Cannes experience mirrors my journey with movies itself, and a love affair that I’ve keenly developed and matured since I was a child.

My favourite that year was Lukas Dhont’s coming of age masterpiece, “Close”, followed closely by the Palme d’Or winner, Ruben Östlund’s Triangle of Sadness, and Koreeda’s Broker. I found “Close” captivating for its poignant and authentic portrayal of youth - set against a beautiful, dreamy backdrop of Belgian flower farms. I often finding myself looking backwards and inwards, in a romantically nostalgic way, idealising the tales from my childhood (and yes, I still feel a child at heart, and forever will be despite my former protests on turning thirty). Times were simpler back then, I thought; but “Close” reminds me that the romanticized notion of youth is not immune to challenges.

I luckily had a mostly uncomplicated youth, but we forget now the trials and tribulations that accompany adolescence, showcasing that every challenge, no matter how seemingly trivial, holds weight and significance in the eyes of the beholder.

My love affair with cinema traces back to the humblest of origins – a cramped apartment in a bustling immigrant neighborhood, where the flickering glow of the television screen became my window to a world of infinite possibilities (imagine the dramatism of Spielberg’s The Fabelmans, but with little payoff). As a wide-eyed child navigating the complexities of a new country, I found solace and inspiration in the stories unfolding before me, each frame a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the universality of emotion.

Fast forward to today. My best adult purchase this year (which I will continue to rave about to anyone who will listen) was a subscription to MUBI GO, which lends me to a hand-picked movie at some of my favourite independent cinemas across London. Regularly returning to the cinema after a literal decade of streaming films on my 13-inch laptop screen felt like a charming throwback to the way I used to watch movies as a child. Reclining in the plush theater seat, surrounded by the dimly lit ambiance and the subtle hum of anticipation amongst the crowd, I couldn’t help but appreciate the simplicity of the old school theatre-going experience. There was something undeniably nostalgic about the communal atmosphere of the theater that made me feel like a kid again.

You just can’t compare to the immersive charm of the big screen, and I recognise it’s something that streaming will never replace. My theatre subscription has brought me deeper into movies, making me long for my youth again - and I’ve fallen in love again. It’s brought me back to simpler times, and I can only hope to recreate that joyful experience with the brilliant silver screens in Cannes.

Attending Cannes in 2022 was a highlight of my life, and it would be an absolute privilege for me to attend again.

I turn 29 this year, making this the last year I can walk the storied streets, grace the red carpets with my fellow cinema-goers, before bidding farewell to my twenties. I can only hope you can indulge me this one last time - for the child in me, and the child in everyone.

Sincerely,

Jessica (Xueyan) Wu
