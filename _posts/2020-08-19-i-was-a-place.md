title: Bangkok, 2017
excerpt: A recount of the morning when I realized I was alone for the first time in a foreign country. I was scared and alone, without any semblance of planning, and two months ahead of me before my flight back home. I was in Bangkok and my last friend from exchange had left for Vietnam that morning. I ended up finding an unusual friend in a stranger I met in Myanmar. Unfinished.

A person is a place. I was a place at that time.

I didn’t know what I was doing there. The morning that everyone left, I walked down the hall in my towel to the cramped shared washroom stall. It was small; it had been recently cleaned and thoroughly too - but you could tell that it was an impossibility to wash the years and grime off the limestone.
I felt dirty, I was tired.

I angrily scrubbed my body with the green bar soap; it had already been used but dried again. Can soap be dirty? The water was temperamental, a little too hot, then too cold; but at least, it was consistent in its fluctuation. I felt small in this big, busy place. There was no one else here in this hotel.

I went back to the suite, and in a daze, lay on the bed, huddled in the white duvet. Not knowing where to go, not knowing where to stay. I was scared to be alone.
I didn't know if we'd keep in touch, but now that that he was gone, I think I missed him. No, I didn’t miss him. I missed someone.

It was coincidental that Josh was here too. I didn’t know him; we had spoken for two minutes in a crowded hostel dorm in Myanmar and I was attracted to his tan skin and slightly unkempt but still unmistakably Abercrombie all-American look. But we exchanged details in hopes of reconvening. Why? He had been travelling for a year, and planned to do so for another 12 months. His passport had run out of pages to stamp so he had to get a new one processed before he continued travelling, or boarded any plane. The closest one to Myanmar was in Bangkok. I felt fortunate that he had these passport woes that netted me a friend in this unknown place - and then felt immediately bad for thinking this.  

"Do you want to meet up?" A tepid yes was all I needed to latch onto, and cement his words in manuscript. Why did we message each other? Because we both had no one else. I wasn’t really lonely, I thought. I only felt it now, after all the meaningful friendships I had felt deeply entrenched in vaporized in a matter of footsteps, trailing away from my bedside. Josh was actually lonely, but I think he had come to terms of it. He wouldn’t admit it to me as transparently as I could see though.

The owner had knocked on my door, telling me it was already past time to check out. He apologized for walking in, but his direct reminder communicated what was on his mind fairly plainly.

There were sugar gliders in a cage in the lobby of the hotel. They had a sour stench. Three large huskies with visible patches of matted fur. I played with them for a little too long as I was leaving, if not only to show the owner that I was a happy-go-lucky girl with all the wonder of the world and a tendency to take things slow, to bend down and smell the roses wherever I went. That’s why I took so long. That’s why I didn’t check out on time. I’m sorry.

Truly the reason was because I had nowhere to go. I overstayed my welcome with the dogs and finally bid my goodbye. I sat outside the hotel on a nearby bench, thinking about what my next step was. I had a month and half to kill time. Murder it.

I was in Sumkhuvhit, the busy core of the city. I smiled, walked, hopped, ran to the other hostel. It was luckily fairly close, perhaps not even thirty minutes. I took in the sights and sounds. Cafes with implausible poorly translated English brandishings - ones I chuckled about to myself. Traffic is legitimately crazy here. The heat permeates your skin with the aromas of tropical fruits and rotting garbage. I feel like I need a shower every half hour. But I was happy. Happy and scared.

When I stumbled into Josh in the hostel lobby, he was in a phone call with his kid. His kid’s name was Asher. I asked him what it was like to be alone for a year, to travel by himself. He was used to it; but I know he yearned for human connection. I wondered what would compel someone to leave his home and his job for a 2-year sabbatical?
