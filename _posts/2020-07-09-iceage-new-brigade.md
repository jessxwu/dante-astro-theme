Not sure why I was so presumptuous, but when Iceage blew up many years ago (probably four or so), I shrugged them off as another nostalgic civil wars-esque band characteristic of kitschy banjo twangs, long flowy skirts, and saccharine songs about Home. I think it was a thing back then. Well, it’s a faddish thing now, but I hated it even back then. Yes, I did hear they were post-punk, but I stupidly didn’t believe it. How can you make convincing post-punk music in 2010?

It’s now 2015, and I put on New Brigade for the first time. Oh man. It’s so undeniably and distinctively post-punk, actually, almost more punk at times. You can hear the modern sound too. I think I remember them to be Danish, but it almost sounds like late 70s, early 80s British post-punk/new-wave. Probably a really daft analogy, but the lead singer’s voice reminds me of Adam Ant. Yet I envision them performing in gritty black and white, wearing distressed white T-shirts and tight blue jeans, reminiscent of the Midwest post-hardcore scene (which they’d fit into nicely too). They have that cool factor for sure. White Rune is so awesome. Collapse is another standout track. They pull it off so effortlessly. Album is damn short, but it works.

Standout Tracks: "White Rune", "Collapse", "You're Blessed"
