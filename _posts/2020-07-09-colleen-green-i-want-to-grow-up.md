Colleen Green’s take on music is probably evocative of the label she’s signed on, “Hardly Art”. Many praise the minimal lo-fi sound and naïve lyrics as strokes of a genius; in reality, she’s probably just lazy. She probably couldn’t do much better, and she’s admitted this herself.

But this is an aesthetic that works. This she also knows. And why not? Genius or hack – doesn’t really matter when you’ve made “Most Read Albums” on Pitchfork. Not bad for someone whose primary release channel is Bandcamp (she’s already doing better than Kitty Pryde). “Deeper Than Love” wasn’t meant to be an existential anthem for angsty teenage girls – no, it’s just a distorted rework of Tainted Love overlaid with some droning mumbles about life and love and adolescent woes.

That being said, I’m exactly her target audience and I love the amateurish songwriting and her laissez-faire attitude. She hasn’t perfected that cool girl vibe yet, and sometimes I wonder if her 420 act is a little too forced. She’s not effortless like pre-2012 Bethany Cosentino, but they’re definitely comparable. And her sunglasses thing is hardly endearing, just kind of odd. At the very least, I’m glad she’s there to somewhat fill my 'Crazy for You' void. She’s also got that lax Southern California endless summer sound (a la Best Coast, that is), but while Consentino forced herself to go to community college and complained to her cat in her bedroom, Green probably dropped out and wallowed in her own afflictions. And claimed she didn’t care. At least that’s the distinction I see. It’s a little darker, more mature, and sometimes a little too close for comfort.

And that’s the kicker for this album. She hits the nail on the head with this self-deprecating quarter-life crisis stuff. This I can totally relate to. She sings about watching TV, the popular girls at school, her boyfriend, and her bad habits. Being normal is so 2015. It’s the new nostalgia. Layer all this with some powerful poppy hooks and crunchy guitar, and you get one hell of an album. I think I reference my love for twee too much, but this is the new age of bedroom pop. We’ve just replaced fuzzy cassette tapes and walkmans with Fruity Loops and Ableton. If only I could get on the train and acquire a legion of not-so-cute teenage boy admirers myself.
If You Will Never Know Why is the album I wish I could make, I Don’t Want to Grow Up is probably what I would actually end up producing.
